What is Java
differences between C++ and Java
Java features
JVM - abstract machine - runtime environment, execute Bytecode
JRE - JVM implementation - software tools: libraries + other files
JDK: software development environment: JRE + development tools - J2EE:Platform 
types of memory areas: Class, Heap, Stack, Register, Native Method Stack
JIT compiler: improve the performance : compiles "similar functionality at the same time"
platform: hardware or software environment: software execute
write once and run anywhere: bytecode
classloader: load class files, loaded first: Bootstrap, Extension, System/Application
static public void ko Khác public static void
default value of the local variables: NO
access specifiers: Public/ Protected / Default / Private 
static methods and variables: shared among all the objects of the class (is the part of the class)
static variables are stored in the class area (common use)
advantages of Packages: easier access control, avoid the name clashes 
Operator order

object-oriented paradigm? objects having data and methods defined in the class
modularity and reusability
Objects are the instances of classes
Focus on data with methods
Follows the bottom-up approach
Encapsulation and abstraction which hides the complexities from the user and show only functionality
