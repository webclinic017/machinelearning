supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms

covering linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, and neural networks

algorithm logically - application

linear algebra

statistics

regression: find the equation that best fits (best fit line) with data / stock prices
- teaches the machine by showing it features and then showing it what the correct answer
- "test" the machine on some unseen data, where the scientist still knows what the correct answer is, but the machine doesn't
- compared to the known answers with machine answers
- meaningful data: historical prices/ patterns indicative of future prices???
- relationship between price changes and volume over time
- more data better prediction
- transform raw data: daily volatility, daily percent change

draw a best-fit line by estimation

basics of vectors
- each "coordinate" as movement in that "dimension."
- direction, magnitude
- Pythagorean's Theorem

Support Vector "Assertions" (constraints) - math
- objective: take known data then SVM fitment/training (optimization)
- hyperplane, dimensions, separating line
- mathematically method play with dimensions
- hm unknown variables?? what is actual mathematical constraints???
- separating hyperplane + support vectors(featuresets~(datapoints on the graph))
- how support vectors impact separating hyperplane
